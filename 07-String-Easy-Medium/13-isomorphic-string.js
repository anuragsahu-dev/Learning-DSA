// Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t, maintaining a one-to-one mapping between the characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

// Steps
// Initialize two maps: one from s to t and the other from t to s.
// Traverse both strings simultaneously.
// If a mapping doesn’t exist in either direction, create it.
// If the mapping exists but doesn’t match the current characters, return false.
// If the loop completes without conflicts, return true.
// Dry Run
// Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

// e → a → map e → a, a → e
// g → d → map g → d, d → g
// g → d → maps exist and match → OK
// All checks passed → return true
// Time & Space Complexity
// Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings
// Space Complexity: O(1), as the mappings are bounded by character set size
